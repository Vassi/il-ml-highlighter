# il-ml-highlighter README

IL-ML (Instruct Language - Markup Language) or (ILLUSI-OS Markup Language) is intended for use in writing AI prompts.

The truth is I got tired of looking at bland text and asked AI to make me a highlighter. Huzzah!

## Features

Provides syntax-highlighting and code-folding on block and heading structures. 

## Release Notes

First release, I am still prototyping the syntax and general workflow and if it lands I will provide some better documentation here as well as an explanation of the actual syntax, huzzah!
